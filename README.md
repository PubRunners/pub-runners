pub runners web application code

This is the current production build of the pub runners web application and contains all source code and database scripts to get the application working locally. 

To run install something like XAMPP stack  https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html , create a mysql db and run the pubrun.sql file then put all the source code into htdocs folder. 

This was my first attempt at a web application or website in general and was an extention of an assignment so be kind :)

currently working on an object oriented version of the app.
